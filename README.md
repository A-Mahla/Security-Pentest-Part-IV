#### This virtual machine is provided by school 42 to improve security skills.

ðŸ”§ System Requirements:
   - Operating System:  x86-64 architecture
   - Software:  Virtualization Software, [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/#), [GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/), [GEF](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) (or similar)

## Usage
 - To download RainFall.iso
   ```shell
   wget https://cdn.intra.42.fr/isos/OverRide.iso
   ```
 - Use a 64-bit virtual machine to run this iso.
 - Configure `Host-only Adapter` (or similar) to get the iso in local Network
 - SSH Port: 4242
	```shell
	ssh -p 4242 level0X@<ip>
	```

## Overview

Contrary to general practice in CTF challenges, a detailed walkthrough to solve the challenge
in interactive mode is provided in each level directory. The Goal is simple :
  - Get the level0X's password in the `.pass` file is located in the home directory of each
  corresponding user.
  - Login to the next level0X's account.
  - To begin, the first user is `level00` and its password is `level00`
  - The last user is `end`.
```shell
level00@RainFall:~$ ./level00 $(exploit)
$ cat /home/user/level01/.pass
?????????????????????
$ exit
level0@RainFall:~$ su level01
Password:
level01@RainFall:~$ _
```
